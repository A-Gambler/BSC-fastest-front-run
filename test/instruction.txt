[17:09:43] 2-SCU: c)You need to approve spending WETH (press approve WETH on the main bot page once)
8)Click the "Run" bot

Bot buying tokens for WETH only.
Bot selling token for WETH or for another token (if donor selling for another token) Token-Token

Make sure you have enough ETH to cover gas fees.
Do not front-run smart contracts. You spend a lot on gas and will be disappointed.
